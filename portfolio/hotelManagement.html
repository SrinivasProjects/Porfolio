        <h3 class="maj">3.Hotel booking system</h3>
        <p class="maj-d">using php and mysql data base</p>
        <br>
        <p class="maj-d">Frontend Development (HTML and JavaScript):

            The frontend of the system consists of HTML pages with forms for users to input their booking details.
            JavaScript is used to validate user inputs and provide interactive features such as dynamic form updates and error messages.
            Users are presented with options to select the type of room they prefer, distinguishing between AC and non-AC rooms through radio buttons or dropdown menus.
            Form validation ensures that users provide all necessary details and select a room type before proceeding with the booking.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="maj-d">Backend Development (PHP and MySQL):

                PHP handles the backend logic of the hotel booking system, including processing user inputs, interacting with the database, and generating dynamic content.
                Upon form submission, PHP scripts receive the booking details entered by the user.
                PHP validates the inputs to ensure they are in the correct format and meet any specified criteria.
                After validation, PHP connects to the MySQL database to store the booking information, including details such as the user's name, contact information, selected room type, check-in/out dates, etc.
                SQL queries are used to insert the booking data into the appropriate tables in the database.</p>
                <br>

                <p class="maj-d">Database Management (MySQL):

                    MySQL is used to create and manage the database that stores hotel and booking information.
                    The database schema includes tables for hotels, rooms, bookings, and possibly users (if user accounts are required for booking).
                    Each room entry in the database contains information about its type (AC or non-AC), availability status, price, and other relevant details.
                    When a user books a room, the booking information is stored in the bookings table, and the availability status of the booked room is updated accordingly</p>

                    <p class="maj-d">User Experience:

                        The user experience is designed to be intuitive and seamless, guiding users through the booking process step by step.
                        Feedback messages inform users of successful bookings or any errors that may have occurred during the process.
                        Users may also be provided with the option to view their booking history or modify/cancel existing bookings, depending on the system's requirements.</p>
